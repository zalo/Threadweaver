# Threadweaver
A Discord Redbot Cog that allows users to react to messages with the :thread: (ðŸ§µ) emoji to create temporary channels based around that comment.

# Installation
Once you have a [Red Discord Bot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) set up, execute these commands in Discord (where `[p]` is your bot's command character):
```
[p]repo add Threadweaver https://github.com/zalo/Threadweaver
[p]cog install Threadweaver threadweaver
```

From there, you and your users should be able to use the ðŸ§µ emoji to create threads.

# Issues
 - Threads stick around forever; admins have to delete or prune them

# Todo
  - Create a "Threads" category
  - Archive old Threads to a `Thread Archive` channel when there has been no activity for a day or two
  - Make thread names prettier...
